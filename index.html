                Out of all quotes by Sundar Pichai, this quote reflects his humbleness and vision. Selfishness might help you to become the winner but only compassion can make you into a good leader. Everyone is capable of growing alone. But in the end, the one who is remembered forever is the one who helped others to grow.
