                <blockquote>
                  "As a leader, it is important to not just see your success but focus on the success of others.” 
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Out of all quotes by Sundar Pichai, this quote reflects his humbleness and vision. Selfishness might help you to become the winner but only compassion can make you into a good leader. Everyone is capable of growing alone. But in the end, the one who is remembered forever is the one who helped others to grow.

                    <li>
                      <p>[2014] Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>[2015] Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on 10 August 2015 after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>[2015] On 24 October 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.</p>

                      <p>[2017] In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing the company's diversity policies and arguing that "distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership". While noting that the manifesto raised a number of issues that are open to debate, Pichai said in a memo to Google employees that "to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>[2017] In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where he stated that “a lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies.

                      <p>[2020] In December 2020, Pichai delivered a speech virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival emphasizing inclusive digital economy. Pichai said at the conclusion of his speech: "Our goal for the post-Covid world is to ensure the benefits of technology can be shared, as widely and equitably as possible. If we can do that, 2020 will be remembered not as the end of the world, but the beginning of a world that works better for everyone".</p>
